# Spark Layer

PySpark examples use the local Spark install. You can also spin up the bundled services by running:

```bash
bash ~/app/services_start.sh   # option 1 starts Spark; option 6 (or --start-core) launches Spark/Hadoop/Hive/Kafka
bash ~/app/services_stop.sh    # stop everything when done
```
