# Spark Layer

PySpark examples use the local Spark install. You can also spin up the bundled Spark/Hadoop/Hive/Kafka services by running:

```bash
bash /workspace/app/scripts/services_start.sh   # option 3 starts the stack
bash /workspace/app/scripts/services_stop.sh    # stop everything when done
```
